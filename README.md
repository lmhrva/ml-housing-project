# ml-housing-project

This is my personal repo of the end-to-end Machine Learning project described in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron, copyright 2017, in Chapter 2. I follow the book for the general project. However, Geron has updated the project in his repo, so most of my code comes from that version.
* [Aurelien Geron's Github](https://github.com/ageron)
* [Ch 2 Project v2 - Final Version](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/02_end_to_end_machine_learning_project.ipynb)

I also have a Google Colab scratch file for the project so I can mess with it when I'm away from my computer and catch up later. When I'm comfortable doing so I might just fork Geron's repo and add notes to it, but right now I need to walk through everything to understand it better.
