# ml-housing-project

This is my personal repo of the end-to-end Machine Learning project described in "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron, copyright 2017, in Chapter 2. I follow the book for the general project. However, Geron has updated the project in his repo, so most of my code comes from that version.
